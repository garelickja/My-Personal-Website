        <p>
          I am a student in the software engineering Flex program with Flatiron School. I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am excited to learn more about software engineering and to start my career in the field.

        <p>
          My career did not start out in software engineering or even anything coding related, I have been in sales for going on 10 years. During my sales career, I have always felt stuck, like there was a better career path out there that I wasn't taking. 
          In college, I took a few computer science and website development courses, and I really enjoyed them. So when it came down to getting laid off from my last sales role, that is what stuck in my head. 
          I did copious amounts of research on how to get into the software engineering field, spoke with my dad who is a senior software engineer, and ultimately found Flatiron. Since starting the prep work, I have definitely had my fair share of distractions, in the form of a newborn. 
          However, the excitement never left about my choice to pursue software engineering. I start classes early next week, and am excited to see where this journey takes me!
